  Short Descriptions
    c++: The C++ compiler
    cc: The C compiler
    cpp: The C preprocessor; it is used by the compiler to expand the #include, #define, and similar statements in the source files
    g++: The C++ compiler
    gcc: The C compiler
    gcc-ar: A wrapper around ar that adds a plugin to the command line. This program is only used to add "link time optimization" and is not useful with the default build options
    gcc-nm: A wrapper around nm that adds a plugin to the command line. This program is only used to add "link time optimization" and is not useful with the default build options
    gcc-ranlib: A wrapper around ranlib that adds a plugin to the command line. This program is only used to add "link time optimization" and is not useful with the default build options
    gcov: A coverage testing tool; it is used to analyze programs to determine where optimizations will have the most effect
    gcov-dump: Offline gcda and gcno profile dump tool
    gcov-tool: Offline gcda profile processing tool
    libasan: The Address Sanitizer runtime library
    libatomic: GCC atomic built-in runtime library
    libcc1: The C preprocessing library
    libgcc: Contains run-time support for gcc
    libgcov: This library is linked in to a program when GCC is instructed to enable profiling
    libgomp: GNU implementation of the OpenMP API for multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran
    liblsan: The Leak Sanitizer runtime library
    liblto_plugin: GCC's Link Time Optimization (LTO) plugin allows GCC to perform optimizations across compilation units
    libquadmath: GCC Quad Precision Math Library API
    libssp: Contains routines supporting GCC's stack-smashing protection functionality
    libstdc++: The standard C++ library
    libstdc++fs: ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015 Filesystem library
    libsupc++: Provides supporting routines for the C++ programming language
    libtsan: The Thread Sanitizer runtime library
    libubsan: The Undefined Behavior Sanitizer runtime library
